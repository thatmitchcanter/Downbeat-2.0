# [Skeleton](http://getskeleton.com)
Based on the Skeleton Framework. Check out <http://getskeleton.com> for documentation and details.

## Getting started

Download the zip file and upload this theme into your wp-content/themes folder.  Once done, activate it in WordPress.  Make sure to check out the "Customize" screen to see all of the options available to you!

Note: To make it easier to remember when you use a [child theme](www.studionashvegas.com/using-child-theme-wordpress/), I would put the theme in a folder named "downbeat".

### What's in the download?

The download includes Skeleton's CSS, Normalize CSS, a WordPress CSS, and the various theme files.

## From the Skeleton Readme

### Why it's awesome

Skeleton is lightweight and simple. It styles only raw HTML elements (with a few exceptions) and provides a responsive grid. Nothing more. 
- Minified, it's less than a kb
- It's a starting point, not a UI framework 
- No compiling or installing...just vanilla CSS


## Browser support

- Chrome latest
- Firefox latest
- Opera latest
- Safari latest
- IE latest

The above list is non-exhaustive. Skeleton works perfectly with almost all older versions of the browsers above, though IE certainly has large degradation prior to IE9.
